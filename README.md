# Stock Price Prediction 
This project aims to analyze stock market data and predict stock prices using various machine learning models. The analysis focuses on three major sectors from the HOSE stock exchange: Materials, Utilities, and Industrials. The selected stocks are:
- **Materials:** HPG (Hoa Phat Group GSC)
- **Utilities:** GAS (Petro VietNam Gas JS)
- **Industrials:** CTG (Viet Nam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade)

The project also examines the impact of macroeconomic factors and political events on stock prices, providing insights into broader economic trends and their influence on the stock market.
## Project Structure

### 1. Data Analysis and Feature Selection
- **File:** `data_analysis_and_feature_selection.ipynb`
- **Description:** This Jupyter Notebook includes the process of selecting the right stock codes and analyzing the relationship between macroeconomic factors, political events, and stock market performance. The analysis covers significant events such as the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis, the period of stability from 2012-2015, fluctuations due to political changes and trade tensions from 2016-2020, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020-2022.

### 2. Data 
- **processed:** Contains cleaned and processed datasets.
- **raw:** Contains raw datasets before any preprocessing.
